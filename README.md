# TowerBot
My first Discord bot! Has a few fun tidbits customized for my game club server (like pickup lines and "wisdom" generation), but mostly functions as a lightweight RPG game. Features customizable pixel art of the player's avatar that changes when items are equipped, as well as when stats change.
